# Responsiveness Basic Porfolio ‚úåüèΩ
# Welcome
In this project we're going to be building a responsive basic portfolio with a stylesheet.
Using the ` @media screen ` tags with the `max-width s: 980px, 768px and 640px.`

## Overview
We use media tags because we dont want any of our content to get cut out when you make your window smaller.
My portfolio is composed of three link pages in my Navbar:
* [About]() - Main index page/ landing page
* [Portfolio]() - Portfolio Page
* [Contact]() - Contact Page


Below is a following example of what my basic portfolio looks like with the different `@media screen tags` 
As you can see none of my content gets cut off even if I make the window smaller.

### Getting Started
You will need to visit Bootstrap page in order to read over the documentation and add the link and scripts to your HTML header.

Here is a code snippet of how your header is supposed to look like:

``` 
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Portfolio | Maira Jimenez</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO"
    crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>

```
