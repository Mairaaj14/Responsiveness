# Responsiveness Basic Porfolio
# Welcome
This is a project where Bootstrap library is used to create a basic Bootstrap-Portfolio.
## Overview
Portfolio has three pages in Navbar that are links that will direct you to a separate page:
* About
* Portfolio
* Contact

Below is a following example of what my basic portfolio looks like using the Bootstrap library!

### Getting Started
You will need to visit Bootstrap page in order to read over the documentation and add the link and scripts to your HTML header.

Here is a code snippet of how your header is supposed to look like:

``` 
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Portfolio | Maira Jimenez</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO"
    crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>

```
