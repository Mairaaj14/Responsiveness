      <h3>Who is Maira?</h3>
      <a>Hello there, my name is Maira,
        I was born in Mexico City and raised in San Francisco California
        
        since I was 10 years old. I graduated from George Washington High School in 2014 and
        continued my education
        at San Francisco State University to pursue a career in Pshychology and a minor in Latino
        Studies. Although I liked the career path I was taking I found myself not being too happy
        and
        decided to explore other majors. Computer Science had always been interesting to me because
        I watched my dad fix his own computers when I was a kid, he introduced me to all the video
        games I know and taught me my first keyboard shortcuts.
        After taking Intro to Computer Science at State they literally had me at "Hello World", at
        this moment I knew I wanted to be able to bring my ideas to life!
        I knew that if I got into coding I could make that happen. I decided to give my career a
        change and decided to dive into UC Berkeley's full time coding bootcamp
        to become a full stack web developer, and master in both the back end and the front end of
        web development.</a>
